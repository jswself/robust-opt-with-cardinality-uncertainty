@article{Park2007,
	Abstract = {In [1], robust combinatorial optimization problem is introduced, where
	a positive integer $\Gamma$ is used to control the degree of robustness.
	The proposed algorithm needs solutions of n + 1 nominal problems.
	In this paper, we show that the number of problems needed reduces
	to n + 1âˆ’ $\Gamma$ .},
